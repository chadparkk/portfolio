              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For as long as I can remember, I have always been singing and playing all sorts of instruments, keeping myself busy with my favourite thing in the world - music. 
              As a young musician, I am developing the breadth of my musicianship as a drummer, percussionist, section leader and bandleader. 
              If there is one central dogma to my work as a musician, it is that I am dedicated to my role as a student, performer and appreciator of all things music, to absorbing as many musical experiences, practice and knowledge as I can, and the pursuit of all facets of music from musical technology, instrumental technique and cultural terminology.
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I started to play the drums when I was 14 years old, the summer before high school. Since joining Holy Trinity Academy for high school, I have performed with all of its wind, jazz and choral ensembles as a hornist, percussionist, section leader and combo leader. 
              Throughout the past number of years, I have studied with Calgary drummer and instructor Tyler Hornby for the past 2 years and have attended several drum clinics and camps from musicians such as John Riley, Afolabi Fapojuwo, Jacob Wutzke, Jim Johnston and Jon May. My current musical projects include the JazzYYC Youth Lab Band Two (under Rob Hutchinson), the Holy Trinity Academy Grade 11/12 Jazz Combo (as leader) and the Pencil Zone Combo.
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am described as a truly exceptional student and musician and outstanding leader, and an academically sought-after and prospective young musician. I have decided to take the next steps of my education in music, taking my talents to the Schulich School of Music of McGill University in August 2025 to pursue a Bachelorâ€™s degree of Music in Jazz Performance with my principal instrument, the drum set.
